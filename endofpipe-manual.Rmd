##Background

<iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/212965322" width="320" height="240" style="float:right;margin-left:10px"frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe>

Water intakes without screens can entrain fish. The following video shows green sturgeon being entrained into a pipe which is withdrawing water at a rate of 570 L/s from an experimental channel [@mussen2014unscreened]. To prevent entrainment, a screen should be fitted to water intakes. If the screen is too small, fish can be impinged on the screen. The [End-of-Pipe Screen Size tool](http://www.fishprotectiontools.ca/endofpipe-tool.html) is used to calculate the required Open Screen Area for a water intake pipe based on the fish species, their size, and the volume of water being withdrawn. <b>Open screen area</b> is the amount of area available for the free flow of water. It does not include the space obstructed by the screen mesh or any supports. The draft [Freshwater Intake End-of-Pipe Fish Screen Guideline](http://www.fishprotectiontools.ca/endofpipe-guideline.html) has more information on end-of-pipe screens. This tool predicts fish swim performance using a model built on 27,030 individual fish found in 132 data sources. For details on the model, dataset and how these calculations are performed, see [Katopodis &amp; Gervais (2016)](http://www.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/csas-sccs/Publications/ResDocs-DocRech/2016/2016_002-eng.pdf). 



In this manual, a sample problem will be answered using this tool.

##Question

A proponent wishes to withdraw water at a rate of 100 L/s from a nearby pond. The pond supports populations of brown trout, brook trout, and American eel. How much open screen area is required?

##Steps


1.  Go to the Select the [End-of-Pipe Screen Size](http://www.fishprotectiontools.ca/endofpipe-tool.html).
2.	Below “Select fish by:”, click the “Group” radio button.
3.	Below “Select groups:”, check the “Eel” and “Salmon & Walleye” boxes.
4.	Enter "100" in the "Intake flow rate (L/s):"" box. 


Once these steps are completed, the tool should look like this:

##Solution

The end-of-pipe screen requires an open area of 2.87 m<sup>2</sup>.

##Advanced options

Clicking the "Show advanced options"" check box allows for much more control than previously possible through the [1995 guideline](http://www.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/Library/223669.pdf), including the the ability to change the amount of time required for a fish to escape the face of a screen, the ability to decrease the proportion of fish protected below 97.5%, and the ability to increase the length of fish near the water intake. In most scenarios, these values should not be changed from their default values.

##Additional information

Below the chart, a line of text displays the design approach velocity in m/s. This information may be useful when using the end-of-pipe screen size calculator in conjunction with provincial regulations or to verify the screen is working properly once installed. 

The end-of-pipe screen size tool can be used to calculate the open screen area needed to prevent most entrainment and impingement with no information other than the intake flow rate. To do this, ensure all groups are selected and the mode is set to "basic". Enter the intake flow and the open screen area will prevent nearly all fish larger than 25 mm from being entrained or impinged at that water intake. It is important to remember that these screens do little to protect plankton, such as early life-stage fish, from becoming entrained or impinged.
