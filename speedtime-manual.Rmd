The [Swim Speed &amp; Swim Time tool](http://34.193.104.83/speedtime.html) generates a plot showing swim speed versus swim time. The plot is dynamically generated based on the fish species/group and the length selected. This tool uses the models described in [Katopodis &amp; Gervais (2016)](http://www.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/csas-sccs/Publications/ResDocs-DocRech/2016/2016_002-eng.pdf). In this guide, a sample problem will be answered using this tool.

##Question

How long can the average 250 mm rainbow trout swim 1 m/s?

##Steps


1. Go to the [Swim Speed &amp; Swim Time tool](http://34.193.104.83/speedtime.html).
2. Below "Select Fish by:", click the "Common name" radio button.
3. In the "Select species" drop down menu, choose "Rainbow or Steelhead trout".
4. Drag the "Fish length" slider to 250 mm.
5. Below "Calculations:" press the "Swim time" radio button.
6. Enter "1" in the "Swim speed" box.

Once these steps are completed, the tool should look like this:

##Solution

The average 250 mm rainbow trout can swim 1 m/s for 250 seconds. 

##Calculating swim speed

The tool can also be used to determine swim speed based on swim time. For example, select the "Swim speed" radio button below "Calculations" and enter 250 s into the "Swim time" box. The plot will update and show the average rainbow trout can swim 1 m/s for 250 s.
