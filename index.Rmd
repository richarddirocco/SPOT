The objective of this website is to host tools which can be used to protect fish. These interactive web based tools can perform complex calculations reliably and automatically. The estimates provided by these tools could be useful in the development and design of fish passage, exclusion, and guidance systems. 

## Swim Speed & Swim Time Tool

The [Swim Speed & Swim Time Tool](http://www.fishprotectiontools.ca/speedtime.html) generates a plot showing swim speed versus swim time and allows one to be estimating using the other (see Figure 1). This tool requires the fish species/group and the fish length to perform the calculations. This tool can be used to answer questions like: 


* How long can a 100 mm white sucker maintain a swim speed of 0.5 m/s?
* How fast can a 200 mm rainbow trout swim for 5 minutes?

For more information on this tool and a sample problem, visit the [Swim Speed & Swim Time Tool Manual](http://www.fishprotectiontools.ca/speedtime-manual.html).

## Swim Distance & Water Velocity Tool

The [Swim Distance & Water Velocity Tool](http://www.fishprotectiontools.ca/distancevelocity.html) is very similar to the Swim Speed & Swim Time Tool but it plots Swim Distance versus Water Velocity. This tool can be used to answer questions like: 


* What is the maximum velocity a 1000 mm lake sturgeon could overcome when swimming 60 m?
* How far could a 150 mm Brook Trout swim in 0.5 m/s current?

For more information on this tool and a sample problem, visit the [Swim Distance & Water Velocity Tool Manual](http://www.fishprotectiontools.ca/distancevelocity-manual.html).


## Length at Maturity Tool

The [Length at Maturity Tool](http://www.fishprotectiontools.ca/lengthmaturity.html) can be used to look up the maturation data of a species. The tool provides a table of references with minimum and mean length at maturity. In situations where mature fish must pass an obstacle to complete their life cycle, the length at maturity may be helpful when estimating swimming performance using another tool on this site.  For example, if migrating Atlantic salmon must pass a 30 meter culvert to reach spawning habitat, what fish length would be appropriate to use in the Swim Distance & Water Velocity Tool?


## End-of-Pipe Screen Size Tool

The [End-of-Pipe Fish Screen tool](http://www.fishprotectiontools.ca/endofpipe-tool.html) calculates the screen area required at a water intake to prevent impingement of 97.5% of fish based on species, length and the amount of time required for a fish to escape the face of the screen. There is additional information on the tool and a sample problem in the [End-of-Pipe Scree Size Tool Manual](http://www.fishprotectiontools.ca/endofpipe-manual.html).
