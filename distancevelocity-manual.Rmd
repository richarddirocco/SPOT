## Background

The ability to predict fish swim speed and stamina is helpful in the development and design of fish passage, exclusion, and guidance systems. The [Swim Distance &amp; Water Velocity tool](http://www.fishprotectiontools.ca/distancevelocity.html) generates a plot showing swim distance versus water velocity using a model built on 27,030 individual fish found in 132 data sources. For details on the model, dataset and how these calculations are performed, see [Katopodis &amp; Gervais (2016)](http://www.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/csas-sccs/Publications/ResDocs-DocRech/2016/2016_002-eng.pdf). The model calculates the mean swimming performance surrounded by 75% and 95% prediction intervals. These intervals show the expected range of swim performance values. For example, 95% of unsampled fish should fall within the bounds of the 95% prediction interval.

In this manual, a sample question will be answered using this tool.

##Question

A proponent wishes to install a 30 meter culvert. What is the maximum water velocity that 97.5% of 400 mm northern pike can pass through?

##Steps


1.  Go to the [Swim Speed &amp; Swim Time tool](http://www.fishprotectiontools.ca/distancevelocity.html).
2.	Below “Select Fish by:”, click the “Common name” radio button.
3.	In the “Select species” drop down menu, choose “Northern Pike”.
4.	Drag the “Fish length” slider to 400 mm.
5.	Below “Calculations:”, press the “Water velocity” radio button 
6.	Enter “30” in the “Swim distance in meter:” box.


Once these steps are completed, the tool should look like this:

##Solution

This culvert should not exceed a maximum water velocity of 0.35 m/s to allow passage of 97.5% of 400 mm northern pike.  

##Calculating swim distance

The tool can also be used to determine swim distance based on water velocity. For example, select the "Swim distance" radio button below "Calculations" and enter 0.35 into the "Water velocity" box. The plot will update and show 97.5% of 400 mm Pike in 0.35 m/s current can swim 30 m.
